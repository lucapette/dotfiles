My dotfiles

This repository includes my configuration files, it also contains a _Rakefile_ for syncing file.

h2. How It works

Just run rake in the project directory to get configurations for:

* bash
My bash config loads completion files for git and rake. It also contains some personal aliases.
Furthermore, It loads *rvm* and sets a very personal prompt.
* gem
I find very annoying that gem tries to download docs for each gem I try to install so I wrote this little file to speed up gem installations.
* git
My git config contains usual configs, some aliases and personal colours. It also contains a setting to load a global *.gitignore* file.
* Pry
Config coming soon
* ackrc
My preferences for "ack":http://betterthangrep.com
* Xmodmap
You should "remap":http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RemapCapsLock caps lock to something useful too.
