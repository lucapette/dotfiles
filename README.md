# dotfiles

This repository contains my shell related configuration files.

I do _not_ recommend to use my configuration files as they are:

- If learning about shell tools is your goal, you won't learn much about zsh,
  tmux and so on by copying someone else' configuration
- The configuration is tailored to my very specific needs so it won't probably
  fit you.

Having said that, it's open source so feel free to take anything you need :)
