description: To consolidate the key learnings, patterns, successful code structures, and conceptual insights from the current session into a reusable, LLM-friendly reference document.
---

Synthesize the core work, discoveries, and decisions from this development session into a structured, clear, and
future-oriented document. This document should enable an LLM or a future developer to quickly understand and reuse the
outcomes of this session.

## 1. Core Task Summary

Summarize the central problem or goal of this session in 1-2 sentences.

## 2. Key Outcomes & Solutions

List the main features implemented, critical bugs fixed, or core modules completed. For complex items, provide **code
snippets, architectural descriptions**, or key configurations.

## 3. Learnings & Discoveries

Document important insights gained during this session, such as:

- New usages or best practices for specific libraries, APIs, or tools.
- New understandings about system design or data flow.
- Pitfalls encountered and their solutions.

## 4. Reusable Patterns & Code Templates

Extract patterns, code templates, or configuration snippets that can be **directly applied to future projects or similar
tasks**. Include brief context and usage instructions.

## 5. LLM Collaboration Notes (Optional)

If this session involved prompt techniques, instruction patterns, or context management methods particularly useful for
collaborating with an LLM, document them here.

## Synthesis Process

1. First, review the entire session's conversation history and code changes.
2. Then, synthesize the content strictly following the section structure above.
3. The final output must be a complete, standalone Markdown document.
