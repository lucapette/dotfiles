My dotfiles
===========

This repository contains my shell-related configuration files. It doesn't
contains Vim configurations files since I have them in a [separated repository](https://github.com/lucapette/vimfiles).

As for my vimfiles I recommend *not* to use my configuration files. I think
you won't learn that much and for sure your needs are a bit different than
mine.

In this repository you'll find my customizations of the following tools:

- zsh
- git
- tmux
- ack
- pry
- dotjs

Furthermore there is a
[Rakefile](https://github.com/lucapette/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) I use
for installing/updating files on my machines.
