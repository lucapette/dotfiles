My dotfiles
===========

This repository contains my shell-related configuration files. It doesn't
contains Vim configurations files since I have them in a [separated repository](https://github.com/lucapette/vimfiles).

As for my vimfiles I recommend **not** to use my configuration files. I think
you won't learn that much and for sure your needs are a bit different than
mine.

In this repository you'll find my customizations of the following tools:

- zsh

[zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) is very popular alternative to the bash shell. A
lot of people out there is using
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) or
[pretzo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), I tried them and I do think
they are both useful but I went for a totally personal configuration because
this way I have the chance to learn new things from time to time. There is
nothing noticeable in my zsh configuration but there are comments so you might
find reading them useful anyway.

- git
- tmux
- ack
- pry
- dotjs

Furthermore there is a
[Rakefile](https://github.com/lucapette/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) I use
for installing/updating files on my machines.
